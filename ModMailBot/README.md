# Running the bot
> Make sure to have java 8 or newer installed.
1. Place the bot in a folder and open a new terminal in that folder. ([Click for more info](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/))
2. Run the command `java -jar Bot.jar`
3. Fill in the Config.yml settings and finally disable the setup mode by changing `SetupMode: true` to `SetupMode: false` DO NOT USE TABS, ONLY SPACES.


If you got any problem open an issue ;D

# F.A.Q

> Will I get free updates?

Yes, you need to DM `Fran#1111` in discord and provide your license key. Then you'll recieve the new .jar file

> Will I get free support?

Yes! Just purchasing the bot is the best way to support my job! That's why I offer free support, just open a new issue!

> How can I stop the bot?

You can write `stop` in console or just hit `CTRL + C`

> What's guild in the settings?

That's the ID of the server you want to use to answer the tickets. [Click here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) for more information

> How do I close the tickets?

To close a ticket write `!close` in the ticket channel.

> I'm getting the error `ailed to retrieve the ticket from the settings and the cache. Please try again later or ask the user to DM us again ;D`, what can I do?

That means that a ticket can't be found in the memory or the configuration files. The best thing you can do is just delete the channel. If the user DM the bot again it'll create a new ticket.

> I don't know what the console error means!

Don't worry. Open a new issue and I'll be more than happy to help :D
