# Running the bot
> Make sure to have java 8 or newer installed.
1. Place the bot in a folder and open a new terminal in that folder. ([Click for more info](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/))
2. Run the command `java -jar Bot.jar` (Replace `Bot.jar` with the name of the downloaded .jar file)
3. Fill in the Config.yml settings and finally disable the setup mode by changing `SetupMode: true` to `SetupMode: false` DO NOT USE TABS, ONLY SPACES.


If you got any problem open an issue ;D
